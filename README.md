## Installation


### 'Vanilla' Dolphin

#### All

First things first, configure Dolphin to use textures

- Options (Menu Bar) > Graphics Settings
- Advanced (Tab)
- (Utility) Load Custom Textures + (Utility - Optional) Prefetch Custom Textures


#### 1080p/4k

Download the pack from the link above

1. Download
2. Copy the `GLM` Directory from `Luigi's Mansion HD Texture Pack 1.0.1b.zip`
	to `..\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures`
3. Launch Dolphin

#### 720p

The best way to do this is probably to download `LuigisMansion720p.7z` from
the releases

1. Download `LuigisMansion720p.7z` from the releases
2. Copy the `LuigisMansion720p` Directory to
   `..\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures`
3. Launch Dolphin

### Ishiiruka Dolphin

\[From https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-luigi-s-mansion-4k-texture-pack-1-0-2-2020-08-01\]

1. Download the texture pack from the link below.
2. Download and install the normal [url=https://en.dolphin-emu.org/download/]Dolphin Emulator (5.0 or higher) if you haven't already.
3. Extract the texture pack folder called "GLM" into the directory \Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\
4. Download and install the latest version of Ishiiruka Dolphin (64x version, the latest version. Not the "stable" version.). This is required for material maps to work.
5. In Ishiiruka Dolphin, go to "Graphics" > "Enhancements", enable "Per-pixel lighting".
6. In Ishiiruka Dolphin go to "Graphics" > "Advanced", enable "load custom textures", "load custom material maps" and "prefetch custom textures".
7. In Ishiiruka Dolphin, in "Graphics" > "Enhancements", set the internal resolution to something high, preferably 720p or higher. Test the game in Ishiiruka Dolphin to see if the performance is good, otherwise try lowering the internal resolution. You must play the game in Ishiiruka Dolphin for the textures to work as intended, not in normal Dolphin.
8. Enjoy!


### PNG Version

Tested to title screen only. Best to use dds version if at all possible.

#### 720p ONLY

The best way to do this is probably to download `LuigisMansion720pPNG.7z` from
the releases

1. Download `LuigisMansion720pPNG.7z` from the releases
2. Copy the `LuigisMansion720pPNG` Directory to
   `..\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures`
3. Launch Dolphin
